# AI Search Algorithms
This project is a series of projects related to the Artificial Intelligence course. In these projects, search algorithms are implemented for a grid world game (In this game an agent should find a series of music notes in a specific order). In the first project, an uninformed search (BFS) and an informed search (A*) are implemented. In the second project, a local search and a backtracking search are implemented. In the third project, the search algorithm is implemented in the Prolog logic language using the PySwip library. 

This project was done in collaboration with @fatemeshafiee and @hehesam.
